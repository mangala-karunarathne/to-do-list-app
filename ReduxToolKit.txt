Redux is configured in this project for global state management. Here also redux 
is used and store all the todo items in redux store. As this json fake data 
providers doesn't allow to change them, add new item, update and delete them exactly, 
that issue has been resolved via redux store in this project. In this case, while 
calling  remote API redux store also updated by dispatching the actions and display 
them back in todo List by accessing updated items available in redux store. 

If it's required to go ahead in this project with new features along with several
other components like headers, nav bars, user authenticatios and role based
approaches then this redux store is really helpful. As there is only very few 
components at this moment not that much different can be seen but When it 
comes to such stage with several other components it's really helpful this redux 
approach because of that states can be access globally and no need to pass states 
as props.
